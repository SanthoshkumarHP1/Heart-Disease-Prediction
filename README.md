## 🚀 Overview  
This project implements a **machine learning model** to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health metrics. The model is built using **Logistic Regression** and deployed as a **Flask web application**, allowing users to enter their health data and receive instant predictions.  

## 🎯 Motivation  
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection can help prevent severe health issues. This model assists individuals and medical professionals by predicting heart disease risk based on clinical data.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source:** [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)  
- **Features Used:** Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, BMI, Smoking Habits, etc.  
- **Target Variable:** Presence or Absence of Heart Disease (Binary Classification: 0 - No Disease, 1 - Disease)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Model Persistence:** Pickle (`model.pkl`)  
- **Deployment:** Render

## 🎨 Features  
✅ **Heart Disease Prediction** – ML model trained on health-related features  
✅ **Interactive Web App** – User-friendly UI to enter health data & get predictions  
✅ **Model Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix analysis  
✅ **Scalable & Deployable** – Easily deployable on cloud platforms
